The only downside is it can leave your toothbrush feeling hard after drying. This isn't too big of a deal for me personally, its just an annoying aspect. You also have to rinse with this toothpaste a bit. If you try it youll see why and what I mean. It leaves a milky white look behind even once you spit it out.\n\nI went a period without repurchasing when I needed to because my husband wanted to try charcoal. It did nothing except cause gum pain. Over the course of this time my teeth started to dull but after reordering this and using it just once, my teeth were already whiter again.

Grassy notes spring up, followed by a whisper of cardamom and the chypre of oakmoss.  After a while, the grasses fade and the cardamom quietens.  What's left is a mossy citrus.\n\nThis eau de toilette surprisingly lasts all day, and most people will find it pleasant.  It is a classic sort of fragrance, but not an outstanding one.

Hill", "reviewText": "The Calvin Klein ck one fragrance is marketed as gender neutral -- designed to be shared -- worn by either a man or woman. Among many included components, the citrus and green notes definitely create a crisp and fresh fragrance but the other prominent scents are floral -- lily-of-the-valley, jasmine and rose. This is where there may be a problem selling it to both genders.\n\nGranted, so much of this is subjective  what we think smells good  so what may not work for one person is perfect for another, but for me, the florals are too noticeable. Neither gender residing in the household liked the fragrance  the male definitely would not even consider using the product and the female disliked the noticeable lily-of-the-valley floral.\n\nThe visual presentation is understated and classic -- frosted glass fashioned into a classic bottle shape with a brushed silver-toned metal top and sprayer packaged in a simple white box featuring an embossed impression of the bottle. The spray is released in a very fine mist and because it is Ea de Toilette the fragrance strength is light. After an hour a small spray on my arm had almost completely dissipated -- little scent remained.\n\nTo create this gender-free scent, ingredients typically used in male fragrances are combined with components typically used in female fragrances. The idea of a unisex scent is not new, but successfully creating one that actually appeals to both genders requires balance. The end result of this fragrance stew is not unpleasant, but in my view is decidedly feminine.", "summary": "Calvin Klein ck one Eau de Toilette", "unixReviewTime": 1430179200}

Hamilton", "reviewText": "Calvin Klein ck one is a scent that I first tried about 15 years ago when I was a teenager. I loved the scent then and I still like it now. It is Unisex which means it can be used by Men as a cologne or by Women as a perfume. I tried it and so did my Husband. I personally liked it better on me. His cologne that he wears is a lot stronger and more masculine. The ck one fell a little flat in comparison. I do love it as a perfume though. It smells sweet on my skin and the violets, jasmine and Lilly scents really shine through.\n\nThe bottle that I received is 1.7oz. It is a decent size bottle that will last a long time...providing that you do not spill it. This comes to my one and only issue with this bottle. It has a screw on cap and no spray cap (like it shows in the picture). I am not sure if I received a box without the spray cap or if it just does not come with one. However, a spray top is necessary for me with fragrance. I have worn this 4-5 times already and I have already sloshed it all over my wrist once. Frankly, I am a klutz and this would be a pricey spill if I knocked the entire bottle over.\n\nThe 1.7oz is the most expensive size that you can buy (currently $28.82 per ounce). The 6.7oz bottle for the current price of $69 is a steal ($10.30 per ounce!). However, that is a lot of perfume. I would only recommend buying that size if you know that you or your gift recipient REALLY loves this perfume and will use it a lot. For me, this is an occasional perfume and the 1.7oz size will last me for years. The 1.7oz is big enough size wise to make a decent gift for a loved one. So, use your discretion and knowledge of the individual you are buying for when purchasing.\n\nI would recommend this perfume. I just hope that my bottle only having a screw top was an error and everyone else receives a spray bottle as pictured.", "summary": "Smells great, but I only received a screw top", "unixReviewTime": 1430092800}

I was impressed with the color, an opaque light gray with a slight pearl to the finish, but it seems a little weaker than the solid gray that we see in the photos. I wore it for about three days before I decided I wanted something a little flashier.\n\nAs far as low-key colors go, it's good for work, play and about anything else. Survives dishwashing well, but the opacity of the color leaves a little bit to be desired. Unlike other OPI polishes, this is streaky on the first application and okay on the second...it requires a full three coats to not be able to see light through the tips of the nails.\n\nOverall, the color is good. I like it better than a comparable polish (I think Recycle) by Essie, has no brown undertones, and is good for all skin tones. However, it made my long nails look short compared to other polishes. Where the moon of the nail meets the cuticle, the layers of color were pretty apparent and again seemed weak, and at the tips the polish wore off pretty quickly, even with a good topcoat.

After I use the remover and let the nails dry, I use a good base coat, one that helps hold the polish.  I let the base dry for 10 min's or so, then put on 1 THIN coat and let it dry 20min's or more then Put on JJa second Thin coat of the polish. After 20+ min's I put on a good top coat, which protects the polish, gives a nice shine and takes away that sand paper feel. You need to put on thiner coats and let it dry longer between coats when using glitter polish.  Also it helps to use 100% acetone remover, got mine at Walmart, to make it easer then reg or even normal acetone polish remover.\nAlso, you can use a thin coat of colored polish after the base coat and under the glitter to give a little more depth.  With this glitter you can use almost any shade.

After I've finished the bottle, I can go about a month or two without it. Typically, I might apply the second bottle only once per week or so, giving my nails little breaks in between before repeating the process. OPI makes a follow up treatment for this product, used for maintenance, but I haven't tried it yet since it's harder to find in my area. I know the price seems a little expensive to some, but, for me, it's worth every penny.\n\nI've been using this product for about 2 years. After you've stopped using this product for 2 months or so, your nails go back to normal. I've always had long nails, but after my second pregnancy my nails would break very easily. I tried gel overlays over my natural nails for awhile, but that process actually destroyed my natural nails. I cut them off, let them grow out, and have been using Nail Envy ever since.\n\nNail Envy seems to make the nail a bit thicker. I still break nails from time to time (especially if they're getting TOO long), but no where near as often as I do without this product.\n\nA hair stylist recommended that I forget about the gel and try this product. I had very little hope that it measured up to all the hype, but (obviously) I was pleasantly surprised. Nail Envy does not work instantly. When you're just starting out (or starting over) with Nail Envy, you  have to use this product as directed for at least 2 weeks before you see a difference. I have recommended this product to other people who did not follow the instructions, and they did not get the results. For the first week and a half or so, your nails may still break and do whatever it is that they typically do. Just give it time. Use as directed, and you will be very happy with the results!

I am going to explain how I find it is best to apply and use this foundation based upon the formula, and then how I think that this performs compared to other products that I have used over time.\n\nWHAT IS THIS FOUNDATION LIKE?\nFirst of all, this is a very thick creme foundation.  This type of foundation is different in performance and application than lotion, powder, or mineral foundation.  More on that later.  The foundation comes in a clear jar with cap on it.  There is no scent,, and it is highly pigmented.\n\nCOLOR?\nI have compared this to a few colors I have access to at the moment and can tell you this color, medium beige Chroma 2 1/2 is:\n-Similar lightness to Bare Escentuals medium beige, but BE is quite a bit yellower base\n-Lighter by two shades from MAC NW25 Studio Tech formula which is similar to this.  It is the same tone range, however.\n\nThis color has a more pink base to it, but is not so pink that it looks strange like some foundations.  This is more suitable for cooler complexions, but not limited to.\n\nHOW TO APPLY\nFirst of all, make sure that your face is moisturized after cleaning it.  Good moisturizing is key.  You can use a primer, if you like.  I happen to really like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Natasha-Denona-Face-Glow-Primer-Hydrating-Underbase-1-01-oz-30-mL/dp/B01MQJMK21/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Natasha Denona Face Glow Primer Hydrating Underbase 1.01 oz/ 30 mL</a>&nbsp;for drier skin and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Swanson-Hyaluronic-Acid-Serum-1-fl-oz-29-6-ml-Serum/dp/B008PPXBA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Swanson Hyaluronic Acid Serum 1 fl oz (29.6 ml) Serum</a>&nbsp;for more oily or normal and  younger skin.\n\nThe way to apply this foundation is to take the jar, open it up and get yourself a Beauty Blender.  I prefer to stay with the name brand as I have tried many substitutes and still go back to the Beauty Blender for the best performance.\n\nWet and squeeze out the beauty blender, so it is damp.  Then dab the beauty blender into the Dermablend and just get a small amount on the surface so that it looks like there is not much at all on there.\n\nChoose a quarter of your face area and begin to bounce the sponge all around that area.  It will look like you are not doing much of anything.  Trust me, you are.\n\nFor under the eyes, take the tip of the Beauty Blender and from side to side, bounce the foundation from inner to outer corner of the eye.  Again, it won't look like you are doing much at first.  Keep going.\n\nYou won't have to get the surface of the sponge loaded more than four or five times in most cases.  You keep bouncing around and around the skin and suddenly you will see that the skin is covered, but still looks like skin.  THAT Is what you are going for.  Any other application method does not do this foundation justice and will not be as realistic/flattering looking.\n\nCOMMENTS\nAlthough I am not as fond of this as I am&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Graftobian-HD-Creme-Foundation-Super-Palette-Neutral/dp/B004IBU2O6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Graftobian HD Creme Foundation - Super Palette - Neutral</a>, which is also available in individual colors, this is as close to it as I have come so far.\n\nMy problem with the Dermablend is this- it has sunscreen in it.  Many times when wearing this level of foundation, there is a special occasion involved.  That usually means photos will be taken.  Sunscreen makes for some pretty weird effects on film.  It will look white, or off color in certain light as well.  You can use this at home and think it looks perfect, but in some light it can look really off.\n\nIf this did not have sunscreen in it, I would like it better.  However, if you really love sunscreen and don't plan to have photos taken in this foundation or don't care if it looks off in photos or on video, then this is a nice foundation.\n\nWear is pretty much all day, even in humid weather, although it does come off it there is a lot of sweating involved and might need to be reapplied in certain situations.  Setting with powder helps a little bit but in really hot sweaty weather, that might not help.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nIf applied as outlined in this review, this is an excellently performing foundation.  Although the color turned out to be lighter than I expected, if applied as I outlined, it will blend well with skin that is not an exact match.  Sunscreen in this will alter photos or look off in certain light, but if that does not bother you, then it still is a good choice.  Great coverage and generally speaking excellent durability (except extreme humidity and heat) this foundation could be an excellent choice for more natural looking coverage that does not crease excessively or crack off.  If applied any other way, results will be different.\n\nRATING\nFour stars because this has sunscreen in it.  I prefer to have no sunscreen in foundation.  If someone wants to have sunscreen, I prefer to add it separately.  If it did not have sunscreen, I would like it a bit better.", "summary": "If Applied As Outlined In This Review, Great Results.

However as even my liquid was not able to handle when my eczema flares badly I was enthusiastic about trying this dermablend cream. First I like the color range, I have pale skin and can have a really hard time finding shade, many brands don't really go into the fair and lighter shades so it is always a tone off. I did still choose two shades but mostly because it is summer and my skin can get a bit darker. The color I choose for universal use is the rose beige. I was a bit nervous with beige in the title but I followed the chart and went with it. I have to say it is just about perfect. I was also worried with the weight of a formula that was in a heavy pot, and my concern was not necessary. A little goes quite a long way, I did my initial application with my fingers, and then blended and smoothed with a damp beauty blender. The formula on this is really impressive, it can go on thin enough to see my freckles with enough blending, or can be gently blended to cover the worst of my eczema. I was really happy with not only the coverage but the fact that it didn't cause any additional irritation and in fact some of the worst areas even looked a bit more healed after taking it off. The ability to cover what is often large raw areas that embarrass me too much to go out has made this a favorite in my makeup collection.

I am very sensitive to smells, especially on my face, and there was nothing that bothered me with this product at all. I am very impressed with how nice it looks on my skin and pleased that it has a SPF of 30. I am older and have a few lines in my face and was concerned that this make-up would settle in the lines making me look even older. I was very pleased that at the end of the day I did not have make-up filled creases in my face.

Being already familiar with the products, I was happy to become acquainted with more. My Durablend story is personal. We have best friends, another couple, that visit us, or we visit them, at least once a year. We go on combined vacations together every three to five years. Wed spent a lot of time together before I learned that my friends face is almost completely covered in hemangiomas. It was a surprise to learn she had to apply makeup to look like shes not wearing makeup. Weve sat together many times since, just chatting while she goes through the process of what she calls putting on my face. Its interesting to watch and Ive asked lots of questions. She applies two liquid foundations and a powder foundation, followed by setting powder. Ive watched at least a dozen times and still find it dramatic. Its not a process that can be rushed if done right, but when it is, it can last an entire day with just a little touchup. I saw it for myself when New York weather caused our flight home to be cancelled. Twenty hours later and way behind schedule, wed collected luggage and were standing at passenger pickup in bright morning sunlight. She whispered and asked me to check if her makeup was still holding up. I was amazed to see no cracking or wear. The foundation was still working. Even the darkest portion of her biggest hemangioma remained completely invisible. She gave me my first Dermablend, a tube of Camo Concealer. Used with the setting powder, it erases the dark circles under my eyes that I get every allergy season. One application in the morning takes me through the entire day without even a touch up. Remembering that, I want to stress the importance of getting the right shade, and that some experimenting is (probably) going to be necessary. I was lucky. She nailed the right shade (light / sesame) for me perfectly the first time (I wouldve picked Natural and been wrong). If you're dealing with a large area, its pretty much a given that youll need more than one product in one shade. While you shouldnt expect to get it right the first time, you just might be able to come close. There are many tools on Dermablends website, plus online tutorials, there and on other sites, that look to be invaluable for making the leap if a push is needed. Dermablend isn't regular makeup. Its confidence in a bottle (or tube, jar, etc). I know the way it feels to use it and not think of the dark circles beneath my eyes when the occasional need arises. For others, that use it everyday just to feel comfortable enough to leave the house, it must feel transformative, as much inside as outside.", "summary": "Serious Coverage", "unixReviewTime": 1499644800}

Normally, I don't like to tan like I did when I was a kid, but this summer I've spent a lot of time landscaping our yard, and despite wearing sunblock, my face has tanned. I did add a little lighter foundation to get the right tone, but it's so nice and dark, it covered all the wonderful dark spots the sun has graced my face with due to exposure. The added benefit is, since the foundation is dark enough to keep my face from further sun damage.

Being already familiar with the products, I was happy to be offered more. My Durablend story is personal. We have best friends, another couple, that visit us, or we visit them, at least once a year. We go on combined vacations together every three to five years. Wed spent a lot of time together before I learned that my friends face is almost completely covered in hemangiomas. It was a surprise to learn she had to apply makeup to look like shes not wearing makeup. Weve sat together many times since, just chatting while she goes through the process of what she calls putting on my face. Its interesting to watch and Ive asked lots of questions. She applies two liquid foundations and a powder foundation, followed by setting powder. Ive watched at least a dozen times and still find it dramatic. Its not a process that can be rushed if done right, but when it is, it can last a very long time. We and our families were up almost twenty straight hours when weather interfered with our flight home. Coming out of the airport and into the sun, she asked me how she was holding up. I was amazed that if anyone needed a touchup, it wasn't her. Id accepted for decades the dark circles under my eyes every allergy season. She gifted me a tube of Dermablend Camo Concealer and a little jar of setting powder. She nailed the shade perfectly (light / sesame) (I wouldve picked Natural and been wrong). I think Dermablend is amazing for the coverage it provides from so little product. If you were counting on Dermablend to help change your life, I get it because Ive seen it happen. If you aren't satisfied that it looks real or natural, I politely suggest that you explore more of the options Dermablend provides. Pay attention to where the shade of your skin falls on the range of hot to cold tones. There are plenty of tutorials on-line to help one pick color(s).", "summary": "Serious Coverage", "unixReviewTime": 1499558400}

I have many favorites among them, yet I believe they all stand very well on their own. Some two or more of these creamy products come with an application spatula, and this appears to be an optional extra.  Also, there is a little instruction leaflet included with every product.\n\nI hope it is going to be efficient way to review all of the ones product in this line, including compatible products along the way.

LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30)\n\nI have been using LOreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick I liked and I later sought out.  It smelled good too. It was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  Also, some of the LOreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and I liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.\n\nI have aged, and my last purchase was a LOreal Infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. I have been so obsessed that I have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. I have a lot of products from their Visible Lift line for my skin texture. I especially enjoyed the Blur ones.  Now I am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.\n\nThere has been more exposure with LOreal in my experience than I can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.\nI am happy to see more high-end products from LOreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.\n\n  1. DERMABLEND COVER CRME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF):\nThis is the first item in this line of Dermablend cosmetics from LOreal that Ive received, and it is my very favorite.  It covers my skin imperfections well.\n\nMy first attempt with it doesnt count, since I spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis I had at the time to show some dry skin through.  And I went out that night wondering why this was happening.  I hadnt read the instructions yet.  First of all, I thought I needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, I thought I needed to exfoliate since I have dry patches on spots.  Now I get it!  This particular crme has to be built up gradually for me. And building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  This product is soft and smooth.  It appeared to be a very thin product at first, and it kind of softens and blends as you work with it.  It is lovely.\n\nIf I use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover varying imperfections; and when I apply it with smoothing dabs it appears blended, and I really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  It has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products I have used. Alone, they gleam in the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  Very nice.\n\nThe other purpose for me is that it has a (30 SPF) sunscreen.  ALL other cosmetics with sunscreen I have tried have (25 SPF) or lower, and not my needed (30 SPF) that my dermatologist recommends.  She has said that even in my home with shades closed I am exposing my skin to potential damage.  I score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.\n\nThe two colors I have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored LOreal Dermablend Pro products with them.\n\nIve been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many LOreal Dermablend Pro products listed here. And I realize you may not have this type of a menu, but I am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.\n\n2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF):\nneeded. The wonderful crmes I love work nicely with Loreal Dermablend Professional Translucent Loose Setting Powder with micronized powder, with the cotton puffs. It hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  This particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  It definitely blends in well.  It is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the crme, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  In various ways, since Amazon is not going to know my exact skin color, I have experimented, I am able to get some creative looks I sought in using the various loose powder shades together:\n Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as I so chose.\n\nA. What I mean is that with the lighter shade of crme I was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker crme and a lighter powder. Altogether, with these medium shades I was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.\n\nB. Also, with the white translucent powder I have found that I am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, I will carefully apply and moments later lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  Another plus 1,000%! For me.\n\nI have found recently that I need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself personally; and not necessarily all over my face and neck.\nU have been using a bit of bright cream blush oddly enough, though you may find it unnecessary; you can still have a dimensional look.\n\nI like to play with the powders, yet, when I am in a rush I will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  Also, I am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. I get rid of this bagginess first.  I will use the powders now, especially with other lighter Dermablend crme applications, or with the high-quality Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. All definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.\n\nOne thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. The powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and I believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  In my case I am fine, and safest when I am well-rested.\n\n3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF):\nThese Dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. Just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  The mist isn't as fine as I had expected, but it works for me.  Even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  It is that simple for me.\n\n4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION (25 SPF):\nThis a product that I had underestimated until today when I applied it under Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because I preferred the varying built-up applications I achieved with the Dermablend Professional Crme, I missed something with trying this last.  As before I was too quick to judge.  I had applied it very thick and then I went out.  I thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.\n\nNot only can I spot- apply this creamier-liquidy product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product wherever as needed. I also can add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders. Win-Win-Win.\n\n5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO!! (NO SPF):\nThis is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in separate compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin.  I do know that is stretching it though. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional Liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I suppose this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a crme or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!\n\n6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY (NO SPF):\nWow again.  I hadnt understood at first how I can use this, as one of the colors I own is a darker bronze; and while I hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  I mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as I applied it - and silly me! I am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash I have. Double win with this product results!\n\nThis is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job without rubbing off too much. I love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting Dermablend Professional Leg and Body Make-Up; however, Im mentioning this Quick Fix product first as Im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, look, only working with the blemishes and letting the natural skins still show through.  This is my personal preference.  It isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed overall as with the full body make-up, yet it is the product I will use first; especially during the day. I love it.\n\n7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25):\nIt is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the Winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  However, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  Not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  I absolutely loved the look when I put it on; and then darn, I was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  This might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you I believe.  As I have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and I believe even because of the staying power alone this Dermablend Pro product is worth looking into.  It just didn't muss up and rub off.\n\n8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30)\nThis works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the LOreal Dermablend Professional Cover Crme, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as I am in my home, shades drawn, as my dermatologist has warned about.  I have already sun damage under my right eye where there is a dark spot.  This covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful LOreal Dermablend Pro line. I have it in a tan color, and I would have thought since I usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. Lovely. Plus 1,000%, and very smart.\n\nVery nice products indeed.

Also, I am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. I get rid of this bagginess first.  I will use the powders now, especially with other lighter Dermablend cr&egrave;me applications, or with the high-quality Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. All definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.\nOne thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. The powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and I believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  In my case I am fine, and safest when I am well-rested.\n\n3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF):\nThese Dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. Just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  Even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  It is that simple.\n\n4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION!! (25 SPF):\nThis a product that I had underestimated until today when I applied it under Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because I preferred the variable built-up applications I achieved with the Dermablend Professional Cr&egrave;me, I missed something with trying this last.  As before I was too quick to judge.  I had applied it very thick and then I went out.  I thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.\n\nNot only can I variably apply this creamier product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product to the flaws. This shade is a tad darker than the other shades of make-ups, so as with the cr&egrave;me, and the powders, I may experiment with altering the look as in 2A.  Win-Win-Win.  I also may add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders.\n\n5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO!! (NO SPF):\nThis is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in other compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a thin cover layer, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer.  I do know that is stretching it. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I am sure this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a cr&egrave;me or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!\n\n6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY!! (NO SPF):\nWow again.  I hadnt understood at first how I can use this, as one of the colors I own is a darker bronze; and while I hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  I mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as I applied it - and silly me! I am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash I have!  Double win!\n\nThis is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job, and which I won't feel shy about adding puffs of Dermablend Professional translucent setting powder so it doesnt rub off; and I will use the appropriate color powder as well as described above in 2A.  This is a lovely product.  I love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting Dermablend Professional Leg and Body Make-Up; however, Im mentioning this first as Im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, less unsightly look.  It isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed as the full body make-up, yet it is the product I will use first; especially during the day. Love.\n\n7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25):\nIt is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the Winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  However, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  Not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  I absolutely loved the look when I put it on; and then darn, I was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  This might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you I believe.  As I have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and I believe even because of the staying power alone this Dermablend Pro product is worth looking into.\n\n8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30)\nThis works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the LOreal Dermablend Professional Cover Cr&egrave;me, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as I am in my home, shades drawn.  It covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful LOreal Dermablend Pro line. I have it in a tan color, and I would have thought since I usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. Lovely. Plus 1,000, and very smart.\n\nVery nice products indeed.  Enjoy!", "summary": "Lovely, smart, flexible, DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL COVER CREME", "unixReviewTime": 1499040000}

Upper lip - massage delicately using circular movements. Lower lip - smooth in a backwards and forwards movement to the corners of the lips.

When I ordered it, I was skeptical, thinking.. it's an expensive bottle of water... I don't quite get it.  But this has proven itself to be a great item.  A quick wipe of this takes oil off my face without drying it out.  It effectively moves basic daily makeup, finds remnants of lipstick that aren't even very visible, and leaves my face feeling clean and pleasant.  It is great for a quick wipe to remove the oils around my eyes from wearing glasses mid-day that can start to sting my eyes by the evening.  It will take off eye makeup if left to soak for a short time with the cotton pad, but for heavy eye makeup, I think for ease and complete removal, I would still use eye makeup remover and then go over it with this product to clean off THOSE oils.  This product is gentle on the eyes, has no taste on the lips when used for lipstick, has no odor at all - I honestly can't believe this works.. but it does, much more effectively than just water on a cotton pad (I tested that just to make sure I hadn't realized all these years I could accomplish this with just a cotton pad of water... I couldn't).  I am very likely to continue to purchase this product when it runs out, and have surprised myself by using it nightly before bed even when I haven't used makeup - I've never been one for a nightly regimen, but this is so quick and easy and I really like how my skin is feeling with cumulative use.

I do firmly believe that we should not expect everyone to sell their products for so cheap they can't stay in business or make a profit, but this is still pricey. And yes, I believe you do get what you pay for, but when I ask myself would I purchase this for almost $29, it would not fit in my personal budget.\n\nThe cream is thick and a sand-brown color.\n\nThe scent is not cloyingly sweet, which I did like, and has a bit of spice scent to it, but it also has an underlying scent that I don't care for and can't quite put my finger on. I'm glad it's not flowery grandmotherly sweet or powdery scented, but wish the spice scent came through even more. It's almost plasticy? Or?\n\nWhat deserves a high rating is how SUPER SOFT my hands feel. It does take a little bit to rub it into the skin and let it absorb, but my hands feel so amazingly soft.  I'm keeping this by me when I'm writing or editing so when my hands become dry, I'll have it close. I'd definitely use this for travel--it's small enough and concentrated enough to take with me. If not for the price, I would love to rub this into my entire body, and on my feet after giving myself a pedicure, but at this price I'll use it for my hands only so it lasts.\n\nThe ingredients list sounds interesting, but honestly it's difficult for me to make a determination on how those things work at a cellular level on our skins. For a hand cream, since we wash our hands frequently (everyone should be!), most of it washes away (unlike, say, a face cream or body cream), so you have the hope that for this price some of the product does its \"thing\" on more than the top layer of your hand's skin before it's washed away.\n\nI recommend if you are looking for a really great emollient hand cream that makes your hands super silky soft and price is not a consideration for you in your personal budget.", "summary": "My hands are so silky!", "unixReviewTime": 1475107200}

This foot cream also contains, among other ingredients, shea butter and aloe vera to soften skin, coconut and jojoba oils to lock in moisture, provitamin B5 and vitamin E, and Ahava's proprietary Osmoter, which is evaporated mineral-rich Dead Sea water that is supposed to draw water and nutrients from the lower layers of skin to the outer layers. Unsurprisingly, minerals are major active ingredients in this product. The cream is thicker in consistency than a lotion but not as thick as a cream in a pot. It smells medicinal mixed with floral.\n\nThe cream absorbs relatively quickly when applied, but you need to rub it in. Ahava recommends that you \"apply generously to clean feet morning and night, paying special attention to soles and heels.\" I did this for a week and found it difficult to tell if the cream was beneficial to my skin. The cream leaves a smooth coating on the skin, like silicone. But no silicone that I recognize is listed in the ingredients. Setting that mystery aside, the skin feel smooth but not supple. I could not feel my skin through the smooth coating. After washing to remove any retexturizer, it did seem like my feet were more supple and moisturized than before. But dead or peeling skin was not affected. This is not an exfoliating moisturizer.\n\nThe mystery of the retexturizer: I was sure that the Dermud Intensive Foot Cream contained silicone -and a lot of it- until I looked at the ingredients list. This is the most aggressively retexturizing moisturizing cream that I've ever used. One application produces a smooth, even slick, skin surface. It is so pronounced that the soles of my feet are still slippery on tile floor in the morning after applying the cream the night before. This is a little dangerous. My toes also slip and slide against each other a day after applying the cream. This could be a desirable effect for some people, though I don't appreciate it. I don't recommend wearing shoes with slick insoles while using this cream.\n\nMore evidence of a retexturizer is the impairment of perspiration. When my legs perspire, my feet are bone dry in addition to being unnaturally smooth. Normally, my feet would perspire more than my legs. It's weird to run my hand down my leg, when it is a little damp, and hit bone dry foot. Again, this could be a desirable effect for some people -those whose feet perspire excessively. But it certainly feels and acts like silicone. Air penetrates silicone, while perspiration and oils do not. Whatever it is, the slickness makes it a poor choice of ingredient for a foot cream. But I'm not a fan of silicone in skin care products in general, so others may not find these odd effects objectionable.\n\nMaybe the foot cream just has an excessive amount of glycerin in it. That is not the only ingredient mystery. Triclosan is an antimicrobial agent that has been restricted  by the European Union and will soon be banned in consumer hygiene products in Minnesota. In addition to disrupting the balance of bacteria on skin and creating resistance, the concern is the effect of triclosan on bacteria in wastewater. The tube of Dermud Intensive Foot Cream that I received does not list ingredients. But the list of ingredients on the box on Amazon's product page includes triclosan. The list of ingredients on Ahava's web site does not.\n\nThat list contains methylisothiazolinone, another antimicrobial that is cytotoxic and neurotoxic. Perhaps Ahava is replacing triclosan with methylisothiazolinone in anticipation of further restrictions on the chemical. This begs the question of why Ahava feels the need to put antimicrobial agents in its products. As a preservative? To retard odor-causing bacteria? No thanks. Methylisothiazolinone is also an irritating chemical and common allergen. Along with the fragrance ingredients alpha isomethyl ionone and benzyl salicylate, it makes this product unsuitable for sensitive skin. Although it did not bother me at first, the cream is irritating to my skin after a week's use.\n\nTo be clear, there a two ingredients listed on the old boxes that are not on Ahava's web site: triclosan and 2-Methyl-2H-Isothiazolin-3-One. There is one ingredient listed on Ahava's web site that is not on the box: Methylisothiazolinone. Which ingredient list represents the product you receive is anyone's guess. Ahava's customer service has been unresponsive to inquiries on this topic.\n\nIngredient list from Ahava's web site: Aqua (Mineral Spring Water), Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Ceteareth-20 & Cetearyl Alcohol, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Sodium Lactate, Propanediol (Corn derived Glycol), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Decyl Oleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Aqua (Water) & Propylene Glycol, Peg-40 Stearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Lactic Acid, Maris Aqua(Dead Sea Water), Xanthan Gum, Panthenol (Pro Vitamin B5), Zinc Oxide, Parfum (Fragrance), Silt (Dead Sea Mud), Allantoin, Tocopheryl (Vitamin E) Acetate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate & PEG-4 Laurate & PEG-4 Dilaurate & PEG-4, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Oblipicha) Fruit Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Methylisothiazolinone, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Geraniol, Coumarin, Benzyl Benzoate, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Limonene.", "summary": "A Decent Moisturizer -with Some Drawbacks and Mysterious Ingredients", "unixReviewTime": 1443225600}

My husband has fairly even skin with the exception of a few sun spots. Having the help of a makeup professional really helped because it gave both of us an idea of how to apply this product and what the end results could be.\nApplication is fairly easy. The product comes in an applicator that reminds me of my chap stick or lip gloss. It comes in three shades and I am surmising that the shade used would be determined by a person's ethniticity. In my husband's case he is an ash blond and has fair yet a somewhat weathered complection. Using the tube you dab this on the imperfection and then feather it outward as you blend it in. It topically conceals the spot sort of subtlely and appears to be somewhat impervious to sweat as long as you don't rub your face.\nBeing a somewhat strange dame I gave this a try on a birth mark on my face near my eye. I used the same technique with the exception of some matte face powder. I thought this worked as well as my female concealer, but it seemed less greasy/moisturizing when compared to most of the concealers I've tried.\nI thought this worked well, was easy to apply and did a good overall job while managing to conceal problem spots for several hours before needing a touch up.

I don't usually wear gloves in the cold winter months so my hands do get dry and chapped - they also get dry from my frequent hand washing throughout the year (I'm a little OCD). When I put this cream on before going to bed at night I awaken the next morning and my hands are still smooth. The cream doesn't wear off quickly like some of the others do and it's not greasy either. I actually bought this product after trying Ahava's body wash, body lotion and foot cream and am a fan of them all. The hand cream doesn't have a strong fragrance so it would be good for men as well as women. Also, a very small amount is needed as this cream is quite thick making it cost efficient.", "summary": "Great for the hands!", "unixReviewTime": 1481328000}

Allantoin is an interesting component as described by Wikipedia, Allantoin has \"a moisturizing and keratolytic effect, increasing the water content of the extracellular matrix and enhancing the desquamation (come off in scales or flakes) of upper layers of dead skin cells, increasing the smoothness of the skin; promoting cell proliferation and wound healing; and a soothing, anti-irritant, and skin protectant effect by forming complexes with irritant and sensitizing agents.\n\nAll of these ingredients work beautifully to provide a wonderfully refreshing and revitalizing hand cream. I love the fragrance because it reminds me of a fresh breezy day on a Hawaiian beach. My hands take a beating as a teacher with the constant hand washing, computer work, and paper checking. AHAVA calms, smooths, and has repaired my hands and nail cuticles.
